Hereâ€™s a **README.md** for your `Local_Deals_Platform` smart contract:

---

# Local Deals Platform

## ðŸ“œ Description

The **Local Deals Platform** is a Move-based smart contract built for the Aptos blockchain that allows merchants to create deals and customers to purchase them securely using AptosCoin. It ensures transparent pricing, automated payments, and stock tracking for local businesses.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

To create a **decentralized marketplace** where local merchants can directly list their products or deals on the blockchain, enabling trustless transactions, reduced middleman costs, and real-time sales tracking.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

* Support **multiple deals per merchant** using a mapping or vector.
* Add **deal expiration dates** for time-limited offers.
* Implement **discounts** and promotional codes.
* Add **event logging** for better analytics and tracking.
* Integrate with **NFT-based vouchers** for proof of purchase.

Do you want me to also **add a step-by-step usage guide** showing how to create and purchase deals using the Aptos CLI? That would make the README developer-friendly.
